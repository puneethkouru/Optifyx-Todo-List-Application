# Todo-List-Application
This is a simple and clean Todo List web application built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users manage their daily tasks by allowing them to add, mark as completed, delete, and save their to-do items. The app stores the data in the browserâ€™s local storage, so tasks stay even after refreshing or closing the tab.
